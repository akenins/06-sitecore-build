          <h2>BEFORE Transforming Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Due to an inconsistent overall customer experience, they often lose
            customers, who perceive their product or service as unsatisfying.
            For fear of this turnover, internal teams face immense pressure to
            develop highly custom end user experiences. This causes a rift
            between development and design, ultimately hindering deployment. As
            a result, companies fail to go to market in time and fall far behind
            their customer-centric peers.
