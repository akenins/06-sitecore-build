                  Servitization models are the new industry standard in the
                  world of field service. As digital transformation has allowed
                  field service to be more proactive rather than reactive,
                  customers expect a higher level of performance from products
                  and the companies that service them.
                </p>
                <h2>What is servitization?</h2>
                <p>
                  Servitization is when a company proactively maintains and
                  optimizes a product’s performance over the course of its
                  lifetime. You’re no longer selling a singular product, but
                  rather selling a result. The relationship with the customer
                  doesn’t end at the time of purchase, but is nurtured over time
                  as they receive outcome-based service to ensure their products
                  perform as intended. But you can’t be everywhere customers use
                  your products, so how can you possibly achieve this? Here are
                  a few tips to help you successfully transition and implement a
                  servitization model.
