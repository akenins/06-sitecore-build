                Servitization models are the new industry standard in the world
                of field service. As digital transformation has allowed field
                service to be more proactive rather than reactive, customers
                expect a higher level of performance from products and the
                companies that service them.
              </p>
              <h2>What is servitization?</h2>
              <p>
                Servitization is when a company proactively maintains and
                optimizes a product’s performance over the course of its
                lifetime. You’re no longer selling a singular product, but
                rather selling a result. The relationship with the customer
                doesn’t end at the time of purchase, but is nurtured over time
                as they receive outcome-based service to ensure their products
                perform as intended. But you can’t be everywhere customers use
                your products, so how can you possibly achieve this? Here are a
                few tips to help you successfully transition and implement a
                servitization model.
